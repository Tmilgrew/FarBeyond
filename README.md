# FarBeyond
My capstone project for the Udacity iOS Developer course

The purpose of this portfolio app is to demonstrate competenace of core ios development skills: UI Design, Networking, Data persistence.  Because of this, some aspects of the project have been intentially over-engineered to showcase these competencies.  Example: the subscribing to youTube channels can be done through the youTube API; however, we handle it using Core Data.

The app intends to remove a lot of the 'noise' from youTube.  I noticed that my experience with youTube was more based on individual videos rather than the channels themselves.  I wanted a UI that was more based on the channel and it's specific content.  This app lets users subscribe to youtube channels, and then presents them in a nice user interface design.

To build, run, and access the app, please pull from this repository.  Afterwards, go to the repository on your computer and lauch xcode from the FarBeyond.xcworkspace file.  Once opened in xcode, press the play icon to build the app and run on a device/emulator.
